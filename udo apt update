[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Run a process in a new container. [1mdocker  run  [22mstarts  a  process
       with  its  own  file system, its own networking, and its own iso‐
       lated process tree. The IMAGE which starts the process may define
       defaults related to the process that will  be  run  in  the  con‐
       tainer,  the networking to expose, and more, but [1mdocker run [22mgives
       final control to the operator or  administrator  who  starts  the
       container from the image. For that reason [1mdocker run [22mhas more op‐
       tions than any other Docker command.

       If  the IMAGE is not already loaded then [1mdocker run [22mwill pull the
       IMAGE, and all image dependencies, from  the  repository  in  the
       same  way  running  [1mdocker  pull [22mIMAGE, before it starts the con‐
       tainer from that image.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m-a[22m, [1m--attach[22m=[]
          Attach to STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR.

       In foreground mode (the default when [1m-d [22mis not specified), [1mdocker[0m
       [1mrun [22mcan start the process in the container and attach the console
       to the process's standard input, output, and standard  error.  It
       can  even pretend to be a TTY (this is what most commandline exe‐
       cutables expect) and pass along signals. The [1m-a [22moption can be set
       for each of stdin, stdout, and stderr.

       [1m--add-host[22m=[]
          Add a custom host-to-IP mapping (host=ip, or host:ip)

       Add a line to /etc/hosts. The format  is  hostname=ip,  or  host‐
       name:ip.
          The [1m--add-host [22moption can be set multiple times.

       [1m--annotation[22m=[]
          Add  an annotation to the container (passed through to the OCI
       runtime).

       The annotations are provided to the OCI runtime.

       [1m--blkio-weight[22m=[4m0[0m
          Block IO weight (relative weight) accepts a weight  value  be‐
       tween 10 and 1000.

       [1m--blkio-weight-device[22m=[]
          Block   IO   weight   (relative  device  weight,  format:  [1mDE‐[0m
       [1mVICE_NAME:WEIGHT[22m).

       [1m-c[22m, [1m--cpu-shares[22m=[4m0[0m
          CPU shares (relative weight)

       By default, all containers get the same proportion of CPU cycles.
       This proportion can be modified by changing the  container's  CPU
       share  weighting  relative  to the weighting of all other running
       containers.

       To modify the proportion from the default of 1024, use the [1m-c  [22mor
       [1m--cpu-shares [22mflag to set the weighting to 2 or higher.

       The  proportion  will only apply when CPU-intensive processes are
       running.  When tasks in one container are idle, other  containers
       can  use  the  left-over  CPU time. The actual amount of CPU time
       will vary depending on the number of containers  running  on  the
       system.

       For  example,  consider  three containers, one has a cpu-share of
       1024 and two  others  have  a  cpu-share  setting  of  512.  When
       processes in all three containers attempt to use 100% of CPU, the
       first  container  would receive 50% of the total CPU time. If you
       add a fourth container with a cpu-share of 1024, the  first  con‐
       tainer only gets 33% of the CPU. The remaining containers receive
       16.5%, 16.5% and 33% of the CPU.

       On  a  multi-core  system, the shares of CPU time are distributed
       over all CPU cores. Even if a container is limited to  less  than
       100% of CPU time, it can use 100% of each individual CPU core.

       For example, consider a system with more than three cores. If you
       start one container [1m{C0} [22mwith [1m-c=512 [22mrunning one process, and an‐
       other container [1m{C1} [22mwith [1m-c=1024 [22mrunning two processes, this can
       result in the following division of CPU shares:

       PID    container    CPU  CPU share
       100    {C0}         0    100% of CPU0
       101    {C1}         1    100% of CPU1
       102    {C1}         2    100% of CPU2

       Limit  the container's CPU usage. By default, containers run with
       the full CPU resource. This flag tell the kernel to restrict  the
       container's CPU usage to the quota you specify.

       [1m--cpu-rt-period[22m=0
          Limit the CPU real-time period in microseconds

       Limit  the  container's  Real  Time CPU usage. This flag tell the

       riod you specify.

       [1m--cpu-rt-runtime[22m=0
          Limit the CPU real-time runtime in microseconds

       Limit the containers Real Time CPU usage.  This  flag  tells  the
       kernel  to  limit  the  amount of time in a given CPU period Real
       Time tasks may consume. Ex:
          Period of 1,000,000us and Runtime of 950,000us means that this
       container could consume 95% of available CPU and  leave  the  re‐
       maining 5% to normal priority tasks.

       The  sum  of  all  runtimes  across  containers cannot exceed the
       amount allotted to the parent cgroup.

       [1m--dns-search[22m=[]
          Set custom DNS search domains (Use --dns-search=. if you don't
       wish to set the search domain)

       [1m--dns-option[22m=[]
          Set custom DNS options

       [1m--dns[22m=[]
          Set custom DNS servers

       This  option can be used to override the DNS configuration passed
       to the container. Typically this is necessary when the  host  DNS
       configuration  is  invalid  for  the container (e.g., 127.0.0.1).
       When this is the case the [1m--dns [22mflags is necessary for every run.

       [1m--domainname[22m=""
          Container NIS domain name

       Sets the container's NIS domain name (see also  [1msetdomainname(2)[22m)
       that is
          available inside the container.

       [1m-e[22m, [1m--env[22m=[]
          Set environment variables

       This option allows you to specify arbitrary environment variables
       that  are  available for the process that will be launched inside
       of the container.

       [1m--entrypoint[22m=""
          Overwrite the default ENTRYPOINT of the image

       This option allows you to overwrite the default entrypoint of the
       image that is set in the Dockerfile. The ENTRYPOINT of  an  image
       is  similar  to a COMMAND because it specifies what executable to
       run when the container starts, but it is (purposely) more  diffi‐
       cult  to  override.  The ENTRYPOINT gives a container its default
       nature or behavior, so that when you set an  ENTRYPOINT  you  can
       run  the  container  as if it were that binary, complete with de‐
       fault options, and you can pass in more options via the  COMMAND.
       But,  sometimes an operator may want to run something else inside
       the container, so you can override the default ENTRYPOINT at run‐
       time by using a [1m--entrypoint [22mand a string to specify the new  EN‐
       TRYPOINT.

       [1m--env-file[22m=[]

       [1m--expose[22m=[]
          Expose  a  port, or a range of ports (e.g. --expose=3300-3310)
       informs Docker that the container listens on the  specified  net‐
       work  ports at runtime. Docker uses this information to intercon‐
       nect containers using links and to set up port redirection on the
       host system.

       If  not  specified,  daemon  default is used, which can either be
       [1mprivate [22mor [1mshareable[22m, depending on the daemon version and config‐
       uration.

       [1m--isolation[22m="[4mdefault[24m"
          Isolation specifies the type of isolation technology  used  by
       containers.  Note  that the default on Windows server is [1mprocess[22m,
       and the default on Windows client is [1mhyperv[22m. Linux only  supports
       [1mdefault[22m.

       [1m-l[22m, [1m--label [4m[22mkey[24m=[4mvalue[0m
          Set  metadata on the container (for example, [1m--label com.exam‐[0m

       [1m--kernel-memory[22m=[4mnumber[24m[[4mS[24m]
          Kernel memory limit; [4mS[24m is an optional suffix which can be  one
       of [1mb[22m, [1mk[22m, [1mm[22m, or [1mg[22m.

       Constrains the kernel memory available to a container. If a limit
       of  0  is  specified (not using [1m--kernel-memory[22m), the container's
       kernel memory is not limited. If you specify a limit, it  may  be
       rounded  up to a multiple of the operating system's page size and
       the value can be very large, millions of trillions.

       [1m--link[22m=[4mname-or-id[24m[:[4malias[24m]
          Add link to another container.

       If the operator uses [1m--link [22mwhen starting  the  new  client  con‐
       tainer, then the client container can access the exposed port via
       a  private networking interface. Docker will set some environment
       variables in the client container to help indicate  which  inter‐
       face and port to use.

       [1m--link-local-ip[22m=[]

         Logging driver specific options.

       [1m-m[22m, [1m--memory[22m=[4mnumber[24m[*S]
          Memory limit; [4mS[24m is an optional suffix which can be one  of  [1mb[22m,
       [1mk[22m, [1mm[22m, or [1mg[22m.

       Allows  you  to constrain the memory available to a container. If
       the host supports swap memory, then the [1m-m [22mmemory setting can  be
       larger than physical RAM. If a limit of 0 is specified (not using
       [1m-m[22m),  the container's memory is not limited. The actual limit may
       be rounded up to a multiple of the operating system's  page  size
       (the value would be very large, that's millions of trillions).

       [1m--memory-reservation[22m=[4mnumber[24m[*S]
          Memory soft limit; [4mS[24m is an optional suffix which can be one of
       [1mb[22m, [1mk[22m, [1mm[22m, or [1mg[22m.

       After  setting memory reservation, when the system detects memory
       contention or low memory, containers are forced to restrict their
       consumption to their reservation. So you should  always  set  the
       value  below  [1m--memory[22m, otherwise the hard limit will take prece‐
       dence. By default, memory reservation will be the same as  memory
       limit.

       [1m--memory-swap[22m=[4mnumber[24m[[4mS[24m]
          Combined memory plus swap limit; [4mS[24m is an optional suffix which
       can be one of [1mb[22m, [1mk[22m, [1mm[22m, or [1mg[22m.

       This option can only be used together with [1m--memory[22m. The argument
       should  always be larger than that of [1m--memory[22m. Default is double
       the value of [1m--memory[22m. Set to [1m-1 [22mto enable unlimited swap.

       [1m--mac-address[22m=""
          Container MAC address (e.g., [1m92:d0:c6:0a:29:33[22m)

       Remember that the MAC address in  an  Ethernet  network  must  be
       unique.   The  IPv6  link-local  address will be based on the de‐
       vice's MAC address according to RFC4862.

       └───────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

       The UUID identifiers come from the Docker daemon, and if  a  name
       is not assigned to the container with [1m--name [22mthen the daemon will
       also  generate  a  random  string  name.  The name is useful when
       defining links (see [1m--link[22m) (or any other place you need to iden‐
       tify a container). This works for both background and  foreground
       Docker containers.

          Publish  all  exposed ports to random ports on the host inter‐
       faces. The default is [4mfalse[24m.

       When set to true publish all exposed ports  to  the  host  inter‐
       faces. The default is false. If the operator uses -P (or -p) then
       Docker  will make the exposed port accessible on the host and the
       ports will be available to any client that can  reach  the  host.
       When using -P, Docker will bind any exposed port to a random port
       on   the   host   within  an  [4mephemeral[24m  [4mport[24m  [4mrange[24m  defined  by

       Both  [4mhostPort[24m  and  [4mcontainerPort[24m  can  be specified as a range.
       When specifying ranges for both, the number of  ports  in  ranges

            Note: the host mode gives the container access  to  changing
       the host's hostname and is therefore considered insecure.

       [1m--privileged [22m[[1mtrue[22m|[1mfalse[22m]
          Give  extended  privileges  to  this container. A "privileged"
       container is given access to all devices.

       When the operator executes [1mdocker run --privileged[22m,  Docker  will
       enable access to all devices on the host as well as set some con‐
       figuration in AppArmor to allow the container nearly all the same
       access to the host as processes running outside of a container on
       the host.

          Mount the container's root filesystem as read only.

       By default a container will have its root filesystem writable al‐

       [1m--stop-signal[22m=""
          Signal to stop the container.

       The  [1m--stop-signal  [22mflag sets the system call signal that will be
       sent to the
          container to exit. This signal can be a  signal  name  in  the
       format [1mSIG<NAME>[22m,
          for instance [1mSIGKILL[22m, or an unsigned number that matches a po‐
       sition in the
          kernel's syscall table, for instance [1m9[22m.

       The  default is defined by [1mSTOPSIGNAL [22min the image, or [1mSIGTERM [22mif
       the image
          has no [1mSTOPSIGNAL [22mdefined.

       [1m--stop-timeout[0m
         Timeout (in seconds) to stop a  container,  or  [1m-1  [22mto  disable
       timeout.

       The  [1m--stop-timeout  [22mflag  sets the number of seconds to wait for
       the container
         to stop after sending the pre-defined (see [1m--stop-signal[22m)  sys‐
       tem call signal.
         If the container does not exit after the timeout elapses, it is
       forcibly killed
         with a [1mSIGKILL [22msignal.

       If  [1m--stop-timeout  [22mis  set to [1m-1[22m, no timeout is applied, and the
       daemon will
         wait indefinitely for the container to exit.

       The default is determined by the daemon, and 10 seconds for Linux
       containers,
         and 30 seconds for Windows containers.

       [1m--shm-size[22m=""
          Size of [1m/dev/shm[22m. The format is [1m<number><unit>[22m.
          [1mnumber [22mmust be greater than [1m0[22m.  Unit is optional and can be  [1mb[0m

          If  you  omit the unit, the system uses bytes. If you omit the
       size entirely, the system uses [1m64m[22m.

          Allocate a pseudo-TTY. The default is [4mfalse[24m.

       When set to true Docker can allocate a pseudo-tty and  attach  to
       the  standard input of any container. This can be used, for exam‐
       ple, to run a throwaway interactive shell. The default is false.

       The [1m-t [22moption is incompatible with a redirection  of  the  docker

       example:

       $ docker run -d --tmpfs /tmp:rw,size=787448k,mode=1777 my_image

       This command mounts a [1mtmpfs [22mat [1m/tmp [22mwithin  the  container.   The
       supported  mount  options are the same as the Linux default [1mmount[0m

       following options: [1mrw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=65536k[22m.

       See also [1m--mount[22m, which is the successor of [1m--tmpfs [22mand [1m--volume[22m.
          Even  though  there  is no plan to deprecate [1m--tmpfs[22m, usage of
       [1m--mount [22mis recommended.

       [1m-u[22m, [1m--user[22m=""
          Sets the username or UID used and optionally the groupname  or
       GID for the specified command.

       The followings examples are all valid:
          --user  [user  |  user:group  |  uid  |  uid:gid  | user:gid |
       uid:group ]

       Without this argument the command will be run as root in the con‐
       tainer.

       creates the new
          volume  on  the  host.  The [1mOPTIONS [22mare a comma delimited list
       and can be:

              • [rw|ro]

              • [z|Z]

              • [[1m[r]shared[22m|[1m[r]slave[22m|[1m[r]private[22m]

              • [[1mdelegated[22m|[1mcached[22m|[1mconsistent[22m]

              • [nocopy]

       The [1mCONTAINER-DIR [22mmust be an absolute path such as [1m/src/docs[22m. The
       [1mHOST-DIR [22mcan be an absolute path or a [1mname [22mvalue.  A  [1mname  [22mvalue
       must  start with an alphanumeric character, followed by [1ma-z0-9[22m, [1m_[0m
       (underscore), [1m. [22m(period) or [1m- [22m(hyphen). An absolute  path  starts
       with a [1m/ [22m(forward slash).

       If  you supply a [1mHOST-DIR [22mthat is an absolute path,  Docker bind-
       mounts to the path you specify. If you supply a [1mname[22m, Docker cre‐
       ates a named volume by that [1mname[22m. For example,  you  can  specify
       either  [1m/foo  [22mor [1mfoo [22mfor a [1mHOST-DIR [22mvalue. If you supply the [1m/foo[0m
       value, Docker creates a bind mount. If you supply the [1mfoo  [22mspeci‐
       fication, Docker creates a named volume.

       You  can specify multiple  [1m-v [22moptions to mount one or more mounts
       to a container. To use these same  mounts  in  other  containers,
       specify the [1m--volumes-from [22moption also.

       You  can  supply additional options for each bind mount following
       an additional colon.  A [1m:ro [22mor [1m:rw  [22msuffix  mounts  a  volume  in
       read-only  or  read-write mode, respectively. By default, volumes
       are mounted in read-write mode.  You can also specify the consis‐
       tency requirement for the  mount,  either  [1m:consistent  [22m(the  de‐
       fault),  [1m:cached[22m,  or [1m:delegated[22m.  Multiple options are separated
       by commas, e.g. [1m:ro,cached[22m.

       Labeling systems like SELinux  require  that  proper  labels  are
       placed  on volume content mounted into a container. Without a la‐
       bel, the security system might prevent the processes running  in‐
       side  the  container  from  using the content. By default, Docker
       does not change the labels set by the OS.

       To change a label in the container context, you can add either of
       two suffixes [1m:z [22mor [1m:Z [22mto the volume mount.  These  suffixes  tell
       Docker  to  relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The [1mz [22mop‐
       tion tells Docker that two containers share the  volume  content.
       As  a result, Docker labels the content with a shared content la‐
       bel. Shared volume labels allow all containers to read/write con‐
       tent.  The [1mZ [22moption tells Docker to label the content with a pri‐
       vate unshared label.  Only the current container can use  a  pri‐
       vate volume.

       By  default  bind  mounted  volumes  are  [1mprivate[22m. That means any
       mounts done inside container will not be visible on host and vice
       versa. One can change this behavior by specifying a volume  mount
       propagation  property.  Making  a volume [1mshared [22mmounts done under
       that volume inside container will be visible  on  host  and  vice
       versa.  Making a volume [1mslave [22menables only one way mount propaga‐
       tion and that is mounts done on host under that  volume  will  be
       visible inside container but not the other way around.

       To  control  mount  propagation  property  of  volume one can use
       [1m:[r]shared[22m, [1m:[r]slave [22mor [1m:[r]private [22mpropagation  flag.  Propaga‐
       tion  property can be specified only for bind mounted volumes and
       not for internal volumes or named volumes. For mount  propagation
       to  work  source  mount  point  (mount  point where source dir is
       mounted on) has to have right propagation properties. For  shared
       volumes,  source mount point has to be shared. And for slave vol‐
       umes, source mount has to be either shared or slave.

       Use [1mdf <source-dir> [22mto figure out the source mount and  then  use
       [1mfindmnt  -o  TARGET,PROPAGATION  <source-mount-dir> [22mto figure out
       propagation properties of source mount. If [1mfindmnt [22mutility is not
       available, then one can look at  mount  entry  for  source  mount
       point in [1m/proc/self/mountinfo[22m. Look at [1moptional fields [22mand see if
       any  propagation  properties are specified.  [1mshared:X [22mmeans mount
       is [1mshared[22m, [1mmaster:X [22mmeans mount is [1mslave [22mand if nothing is  there
       that means mount is [1mprivate[22m.

       To  change propagation properties of a mount point use [1mmount [22mcom‐
       mand. For example, if one wants to bind  mount  source  directory
       [1m/foo  [22mone  can do [1mmount --bind /foo /foo [22mand [1mmount --make-private[0m
       [1m--make-shared /foo[22m. This will convert /foo into  a  [1mshared  [22mmount
       point.  Alternatively one can directly change propagation proper‐
       ties of source mount. Say [1m/ [22mis source mount for  [1m/foo[22m,  then  use
       [1mmount --make-shared / [22mto convert [1m/ [22minto a [1mshared [22mmount.

              [1mNote[22m:  When  using  systemd  to manage the Docker daemon's
              start and stop, in the systemd unit file there is  an  op‐
              tion  to  control  mount propagation for the Docker daemon
              itself, called [1mMountFlags[22m. The value of this  setting  may
              cause  Docker to not see mount propagation changes made on
              the mount point. For example, if this value is [1mslave[22m,  you
              may  not  be able to use the [1mshared [22mor [1mrshared [22mpropagation
              on a volume.

       To disable automatic copying of data from the container  path  to
       the  volume,  use  the [1mnocopy [22mflag. The [1mnocopy [22mflag can be set on
       bind mounts and named volumes.

       See also [1m--mount[22m, which is the successor of [1m--tmpfs [22mand [1m--volume[22m.
       Even though there is no plan  to  deprecate  [1m--volume[22m,  usage  of
       [1m--mount [22mis recommended.

       [1m--volume-driver[22m=""
          Container's  volume driver. This driver creates volumes speci‐
       fied either from
          a Dockerfile's [1mVOLUME [22minstruction or from the  [1mdocker  run  -v[0m
       flag.
          See [1mdocker-volume-create(1) [22mfor full details.

       [1m--volumes-from[22m=[]
          Mount volumes from the specified container(s)

       Mounts  already  mounted volumes from a source container onto an‐
       other
          container. You must supply the source's container-id. To share
          a volume, use the [1m--volumes-from [22moption when running
          the target container. You can share volumes even if the source
       container
          is not running.

       By default, Docker mounts the volumes in  the  same  mode  (read-
       write or
          read-only)  as  it is mounted in the source container. Option‐
       ally, you
          can change this by suffixing the container-id with either  the
       [1m:ro [22mor
          [1m:rw [22mkeyword.

       If  the location of the volume from the source container overlaps
       with
          data residing on a target container, then the volume hides
          that data on the target.

       [1m-w[22m, [1m--workdir[22m=""
          Working directory inside the container

       The default working directory for running binaries within a  con‐
       tainer is the root directory (/). The developer can set a differ‐
       ent default with the Dockerfile WORKDIR instruction. The operator
       can override the working directory by using the [1m-w [22moption.

[1mRunning container in read-only mode[0m
       During container image  development,  containers  often  need  to
       write  to  the image content.  Installing packages into /usr, for
       example.  In production, applications seldom need to write to the
       image.  Container applications write to volumes if they  need  to
       write  to file systems at all.  Applications can be made more se‐
       cure by running them in  read-only  mode  using  the  --read-only
       switch.   This  protects  the containers image from modification.
       Read only containers may still need to write temporary data.  The
       best way to handle this is to mount tmpfs directories on /run and
       /tmp.

       # docker run --read-only --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /tmp -i -t fedora /bin/bash

[1mExposing log messages from the container to the host's log[0m
       If you want messages that are logged in your container to show up
       in the host's syslog/journal  then  you  should  bind  mount  the
       /dev/log directory as follows.

       # docker run -v /dev/log:/dev/log -i -t fedora /bin/bash

       From  inside the container you can test this by sending a message
       to the log.

       (bash)# logger "Hello from my container"

       Then exit and check the journal.

       # exit

       # journalctl -b | grep Hello

       This should list the message sent to logger.

[1mAttaching to one or more from STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR[0m
       If you do not specify  -a  then  Docker  will  attach  everything
       (stdin,stdout,stderr)  .  You  can  specify to which of the three
       standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) you'd  like  to  connect
       instead, as in:

       # docker run -a stdin -a stdout -i -t fedora /bin/bash

[1mSharing IPC between containers[0m

       https://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node27.html

       Testing [1m--ipc=host [22mmode:

       Host shows a shared memory segment with 7 pids attached,  happens
       to be from httpd:

        $ sudo ipcs -m

        ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
        key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
        0x01128e25 0          root       600        1000       7

       Now  run  a  regular container, and it correctly does NOT see the
       shared memory segment from the host:

        $ docker run -it shm ipcs -m

        ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
        key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status

       Run a container with the new [1m--ipc=host [22moption, and it  now  sees
       the shared memory segment from the host httpd:

        $ docker run -it --ipc=host shm ipcs -m

        ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
        key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
        0x01128e25 0          root       600        1000       7

       Testing [1m--ipc=container:CONTAINERID [22mmode:

       Start  a  container with a program to create a shared memory seg‐
       ment:

        $ docker run -it shm bash
        $ sudo shm/shm_server &
        $ sudo ipcs -m

        ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
        key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
        0x0000162e 0          root       666        27         1

       Create a 2nd container correctly shows no shared  memory  segment
       from 1st container:

        $ docker run shm ipcs -m

        ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
        key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status

       Create  a 3rd container using the new --ipc=container:CONTAINERID
       option, now it shows the shared memory segment from the first:

        $ docker run -it --ipc=container:ed735b2264ac shm ipcs -m
        $ sudo ipcs -m

        ------ Shared Memory Segments --------

[1mLinking Containers[0m
              [1mNote[22m: This section describes linking between containers on
              the  default  (bridge)  network,  also  known  as  "legacy
              links".  Using  [1m--link  [22mon  user-defined networks uses the
              DNS-based  discovery,  which  does  not  add  entries   to
              [1m/etc/hosts[22m,  and  does  not  set environment variables for
              discovery.

       The link feature allows multiple containers to  communicate  with
       each other. For example, a container whose Dockerfile has exposed
       port 80 can be run and named as follows:

       # docker run --name=link-test -d -i -t fedora/httpd

       A  second  container, in this case called linker, can communicate
       with the httpd container, named link-test, by  running  with  the
       [1m--link=:[0m

       # docker run -t -i --link=link-test:lt --name=linker fedora /bin/bash

       Now  the  container  linker is linked to container link-test with
       the alias lt.  Running the [1menv [22mcommand in  the  linker  container
       shows environment variables
        with the LT (alias) context ([1mLT_[22m)

       # env
       HOSTNAME=668231cb0978
       TERM=xterm
       LT_PORT_80_TCP=tcp://172.17.0.3:80
       LT_PORT_80_TCP_PORT=80
       LT_PORT_80_TCP_PROTO=tcp
       LT_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.3:80
       PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
       PWD=/
       LT_NAME=/linker/lt
       SHLVL=1
       HOME=/
       LT_PORT_80_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.3
       _=/usr/bin/env

       When  linking two containers Docker will use the exposed ports of
       the container to create a secure tunnel for the parent to access.

       If a container is connected to the  default  bridge  network  and
       [1mlinked  [22mwith  other  containers,  then the container's [1m/etc/hosts[0m
       file is updated with the linked container's name.

              [1mNote  [22mSince  Docker  may  live  update   the   container's
              [1m/etc/hosts  [22mfile,  there  may be situations when processes
              inside the container can end up reading an empty or incom‐
              plete [1m/etc/hosts [22mfile. In most cases,  retrying  the  read
              again should fix the problem.

[1mMapping Ports for External Usage[0m
       The  exposed  port of an application can be mapped to a host port
       using the [1m-p [22mflag. For example, an httpd port 80 can be mapped to
       the host port 8080 using the following:

       # docker run -p 8080:80 -d -i -t fedora/httpd

[1mCreating and Mounting a Data Volume Container[0m
       Many applications require the sharing of persistent  data  across
       several  containers.  Docker  allows  you to create a Data Volume
       Container that other containers can mount from. For example, cre‐
       ate a named container that contains directories /var/volume1  and
       /tmp/volume2. The image will need to contain these directories so
       a  couple of RUN mkdir instructions might be required for you fe‐
       dora-data image:

       # docker run --name=data -v /var/volume1 -v /tmp/volume2 -i -t fedora-data true
       # docker run --volumes-from=data --name=fedora-container1 -i -t fedora bash

       Multiple --volumes-from parameters will bring  together  multiple
       data volumes from multiple containers. And it's possible to mount
       the volumes that came from the DATA container in yet another con‐
       tainer via the fedora-container1 intermediary container, allowing
       to abstract the actual data source from users of that data:

       # docker run --volumes-from=fedora-container1 --name=fedora-container2 -i -t fedora bash

[1mMounting External Volumes[0m
       To  mount a host directory as a container volume, specify the ab‐
       solute path to the directory and the absolute path for  the  con‐
       tainer directory separated by a colon:

       # docker run -v /var/db:/data1 -i -t fedora bash

       When  using  SELinux,  be aware that the host has no knowledge of
       container SELinux policy. Therefore, in  the  above  example,  if
       SELinux policy is enforced, the [1m/var/db [22mdirectory is not writable
       to the container. A "Permission Denied" message will occur and an
       avc: message in the host's syslog.

       To  work  around this, at time of writing this man page, the fol‐
       lowing command needs to be run in order for  the  proper  SELinux
       policy type label to be attached to the host directory:

       # chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /var/db

       Now,  writing  to  the /data1 volume in the container will be al‐
       lowed and the changes will also  be  reflected  on  the  host  in
       /var/db.

[1mUsing alternative security labeling[0m
       You  can  override the default labeling scheme for each container
       by specifying the [1m--security-opt [22mflag. For example, you can spec‐
       ify the MCS/MLS level, a requirement for MLS systems.  Specifying
       the  level  in the following command allows you to share the same
       content between containers.

       # docker run --security-opt label=level:s0:c100,c200 -i -t fedora bash

       An MLS example might be:

       # docker run --security-opt label=level:TopSecret -i -t rhel7 bash

       To disable the security labeling for this container  versus  run‐
       ning with the [1m--permissive [22mflag, use the following command:

       # docker run --security-opt label=disable -i -t fedora bash

       If  you  want a tighter security policy on the processes within a
       container, you can specify an alternate type for  the  container.
       You  could  run  a  container  that  is only allowed to listen on
       Apache ports by executing the following command:

       # docker run --security-opt label=type:svirt_apache_t -i -t centos bash

       Note:

       You would have to write policy defining a [1msvirt_apache_t [22mtype.

[1mSetting device weight[0m
       If you want to set [1m/dev/sda [22mdevice weight to [1m200[22m, you can specify
       the device weight by [1m--blkio-weight-device [22mflag. Use the  follow‐
       ing command:

       # docker run -it --blkio-weight-device "/dev/sda:200" ubuntu

[1mSpecify isolation technology for container (--isolation)[0m
       This  option is useful in situations where you are running Docker
       containers on Microsoft Windows. The [1m--isolation  <value>  [22moption
       sets  a container's isolation technology. On Linux, the only sup‐
       ported is the [1mdefault [22moption which uses Linux  namespaces.  These
       two commands are equivalent on Linux:

       $ docker run -d busybox top
       $ docker run -d --isolation default busybox top

       On Microsoft Windows, can take any of these values:

              • [1mdefault[22m:  Use the value specified by the Docker daemon's
                [1m--exec-opt [22m. If the [1mdaemon [22mdoes not specify an isolation
                technology, Microsoft Windows uses [1mprocess  [22mas  its  de‐
                fault value.

              • [1mprocess[22m: Namespace isolation only.

              • [1mhyperv[22m: Hyper-V hypervisor partition-based isolation.

       In  practice,  when running on Microsoft Windows without a [1mdaemon[0m
       option set,  these two commands are equivalent:

       $ docker run -d --isolation default busybox top
       $ docker run -d --isolation process busybox top

       If you have set the [1m--exec-opt  isolation=hyperv  [22moption  on  the
       Docker [1mdaemon[22m, any of these commands also result in [1mhyperv [22misola‐
       tion:

       $ docker run -d --isolation default busybox top
       $ docker run -d --isolation hyperv busybox top

[1mSetting Namespaced Kernel Parameters (Sysctls)[0m
       The  [1m--sysctl  [22msets namespaced kernel parameters (sysctls) in the
       container. For example, to turn on IP forwarding in the  contain‐
       ers network namespace, run this command:

       $ docker run --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 someimage

       Note:

       Not  all sysctls are namespaced. Docker does not support changing
       sysctls inside of a container that also modify the  host  system.
       As  the kernel evolves we expect to see more sysctls become name‐
       spaced.

       See the definition of the [1m--sysctl [22moption above for  the  current
       list of supported sysctls.
